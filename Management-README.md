# Management README

## Introduction

This document outlines my management philosophy, core values, and how I approach leading engineering teams. My goal is to create an environment where you can do your best work, grow in your career, and deliver meaningful impact for our customers and business.

I believe great teams are built on trust, clear communication, and shared ownership. I'm here to support you, remove blockers, and help connect your work to our larger strategic goals.

## My Core Values

These four principles guide every decision I make as a manager:

### 1. Grow people through impactful work
I get energized by connecting your individual career growth to meaningful customer and business outcomes. Success means you're advancing your skills while delivering work that matters. I'll help you identify growth opportunities and ensure your contributions have clear strategic value.

### 2. Build sustainable excellence
High performance doesn't require burnout. We achieve quality without perfectionism, focusing on what truly matters for our customers. I believe we can be a continuously improving team while respecting work-life harmony. Long grueling hours should be the exception, not the rule.

### 3. Empower shared ownership
Like Total Football, where any player can fill any role, I believe teams are most effective when we can distribute and share responsibilities while maintaining clear accountability. Everyone should be able to contribute across different areas while owning their specific domains.

### 4. Start with the customer, iterate with purpose
We begin with customer needs and work backwards to find solutions. Then we improve incrementally through transparent goals and continuous feedback. Build only what's needed - avoid premature optimization and unnecessary complexity.

## How I Work

### Communication Style
- **Direct and honest feedback**: No one should ever be surprised by their performance. I believe in continuous feedback, both positive and constructive, given with respect and in service of growth.
- **Open to feedback**: I actively seek input on my own performance and decisions. Please share your thoughts on what's working and what isn't.
- **Transparent information sharing**: I'll keep you informed about strategic context, priorities, and organizational changes that affect our work.

### Meetings & 1:1s
- **Regular 1:1s**: Weekly or bi-weekly focused on your growth, blockers, and career development
- **Team meetings**: Focused on alignment, information sharing, and collaborative problem-solving
- **SMART goals**: We'll set clear, measurable goals at the team level that everyone can see and contribute to

### Decision Making
- **Collaborative approach**: I prefer working together to find solutions rather than making unilateral decisions
- **Context over control**: I'll provide strategic context so you can make informed decisions autonomously
- **Bias for action**: We'll move forward with imperfect information rather than over-analyzing

## What You Can Expect From Me

- **Career development support**: I'll help you identify growth opportunities and create development plans aligned with your goals
- **Blocker removal**: I'll work to eliminate obstacles that prevent you from doing your best work
- **Strategic context**: I'll connect your work to customer impact and business objectives so you understand the "why"
- **Stakeholder management**: I'll manage relationships with other teams and handle organizational friction
- **Technical investment advocacy**: I'll fight for time and resources to address technical debt alongside feature work
- **Sustainable workload**: I'll push back on unrealistic timelines and scope to protect team well-being

## What I Expect From You

- **End-to-end ownership**: Take responsibility for your projects from conception to delivery and maintenance
- **Continuous learning**: Stay curious and invest in your professional growth
- **Quality focus**: Ship work that meets our standards - core experience and high-impact edge cases handled well
- **Collaborative problem-solving**: Work with others to find solutions, don't operate in silos
- **Customer awareness**: Understand how your work impacts our users and business goals
- **Transparent communication**: Share blockers, risks, and decisions early and openly

## My Approach to Growth & Development

I believe in growing people through challenging, impactful work rather than just training or courses. Here's how I approach development:

- **Stretch assignments**: I'll help you take on projects that push your skills while providing support
- **Cross-functional exposure**: Opportunities to work with different teams and understand broader business context
- **Technical depth and breadth**: Balance between specialization and broader engineering skills
- **Leadership opportunities**: Chances to mentor others, lead initiatives, and influence technical direction
- **Regular career conversations**: Ongoing discussions about your goals and how to achieve them

## Technical Philosophy

- **Incremental improvement**: We'll consistently invest in technical debt alongside commercial work, not wait for dedicated time
- **Simple, essential solutions**: Build what customers need without unnecessary complexity or premature optimization
- **Architecture that serves the business**: Technical decisions should enable faster, better customer value delivery
- **Quality without perfectionism**: Focus on core experience and high-impact scenarios, iterate on the rest

## Conflict & Difficult Conversations

When issues arise:
- **Address problems early**: Don't let small issues become big problems
- **Focus on behavior and impact**: Discuss specific situations rather than personality traits
- **Collaborative problem-solving**: Work together to find solutions that work for everyone
- **Assume positive intent**: Start from the assumption that people want to do good work
- **Escalate when needed**: Some problems require broader organizational involvement

## Questions & Feedback

I'm always open to questions about my management style, decisions, or anything else. Please don't hesitate to:
- Ask for clarification on expectations or priorities
- Share feedback on how I can better support you
- Raise concerns about team dynamics or processes
- Suggest improvements to how we work together

Remember, my job is to help you succeed. If something isn't working, let's talk about it and figure out a better way forward.
